# Final Project - Remote Data Acquisition

## Description

This is the repository for the final project, part of the Computer Science Course. The main goal of this project is remote data acquisition of temperature and humidity values. The captured data is transmitted to The Things Network (TTN) and subsequently displayed in a web application for management.
